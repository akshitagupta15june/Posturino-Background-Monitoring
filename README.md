# Posturino-HackOn




During this Covid-19 era, many of us spend most of our days hunched over a desk, leaning forward looking at a computer screen, or slumped down in our chair. If you’re like me, you’re only reminded of your bad posture when your neck or shoulders hurt hours later, or you have a splitting migraine. These problems appear gradually if the person repeatedly assumes incorrect postures for a prolonged period of time. 


Can we design a technology that can alarm or monitor us while we spent our time in front of our computers?
